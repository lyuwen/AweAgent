            Use the tool to think about something. It will not obtain new \

Use it when complex reasoning or brainstorming is needed.

            Common use cases:
            1. When exploring a repository and discovering the source of a bug, \
call this tool to brainstorm several unique ways of fixing the bug, and assess \
which change(s) are likely to be simplest and most effective.
            2. After receiving test results, use this tool to brainstorm ways to fix failing tests.
            3. When planning a complex refactoring, use this tool to outline different \
approaches and their tradeoffs.
            4. When designing a new feature, use this tool to think through architecture \
decisions and implementation details.
            5. When debugging a complex issue, use this tool to organize your thoughts \
and hypotheses.

            The tool simply logs your thought process for better transparency and does \
not execute any code or make changes.""")
